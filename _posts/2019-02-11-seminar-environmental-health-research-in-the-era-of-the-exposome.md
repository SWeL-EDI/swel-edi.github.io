**Title:** Environmental Health Research in the Era of the ‘Exposome’

**Speaker:** Miranda Loh, Sc.D., Senior Scientist at the Institute of Occupational Medicine

**Date:** 11:15 on February 2019

**Location:** CM F.17, Heriot-Watt University

**Abstract:** In 2015, an estimated 9 million premature deaths were caused by pollution, with air pollution as the leading environmental risk factor. The potential environmental burden of disease could be even larger, as there are still many unknown causes of disease. Much of this uncertainty around the cause of diseases comes from poor description of environmental and occupational exposures in epidemiological studies. Current research into characterising the exposome, the sum total of all exposures through an individual’s lifetime, aims at improving exposure science and our understanding of the relationships between environment and health. There has been great interest in the exposome community in using sensors and smart technologies to further assessment of environmental, behavioural, and health information for individuals. This seminar will explore current interests in the use of technology in exposome research.
