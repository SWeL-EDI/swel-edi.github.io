On 30 June 2017 I will be leaving my current employment at Heriot-Watt University. I aim to continue to support the use of technology to enhance learning as an independent consultant.

I first joined Heriot-Watt’s Institute for Computer Based Learning in 1996 on a six month secondment. I was impressed that ICBL was part of a large, well-supported Learning Technology Centre–which was acknowledged at that time as one of the leading centres for the use of technology in teaching and learning. You can get a sense of the scope of the LTC by looking at the [staff list from around that time](https://web.archive.org/web/19980611122940/http://www.ltc.hw.ac.uk:80/staff.html). Working with, and learning from, colleagues with this common interest was hugely appealing to me; so when I had the opportunity I re-joined ICBL in 1997, and this time I stayed.

In my time at Heriot-Watt I have been fortunate beyond belief to collaborate with [people in ICBL](http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/people) and through work such as the [Engineering Subject Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_Subject_Centre) (and other subject centres of the LTSN and then HE Academy), EEVL, Cetis and many Jisc projects. But things change. The LTC was dismantled. A reduced ICBL moved to be a part of the Computer part of the School of Mathematics and Computer Sciences (MACS). Funding became difficult, and while I greatly appreciate the huge effort made by several individuals which kept me in continuous employment, like many in similar roles I frequently felt my position was precarious. I really enjoyed teaching Computer Science and Information Systems students, and I worked with some great people in MACS, but the work became more internally focused, isolated from current developments…not what I had joined ICBL for.

## What next?

When Heriot-Watt [announced](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-39180860) that it planned to offer staff voluntary severance terms, I applied and was happy to be accepted. My professional interests remain the same: supporting the selection and use appropriate learning resources; supporting the management and dissemination of learning resources; open education; sharing and learning. I do this through work on [resource description](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/topics/metadata/), [course description](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/topics/course-description/), [OER platforms](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/topics/repositories/), I use specific technologies like [schema.org](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/topics/schema-org/), [LRMI](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/topics/lrmi/) and [wordpress](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/topics/wordpress/). I intend to continue working in these areas, as an independent consultant and with colleagues in [Cetis LLP](http://www.cetis.org.uk/). [Contact me](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/contact/) if you think I can help you.
