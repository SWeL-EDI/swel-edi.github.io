**Venue:** [F.17. Colin Maclaurin Building](http://www.hw.ac.uk/student-life/campus-life/edinburgh/colin-maclaurin-building.htm), Heriot-Watt University

**Title:** Managing Domain-Aware Lexical Knowledge

**Speaker:** [<span class="s1">David Leoni</span>](https://github.com/DavidLeoni), Heriot-Watt University

**Abstract:** <span class="s1">The talk will describe the implementation of Diversicon, a new open source </span><span class="s1">system for extending and integrating terminologies as found in Wordnet </span><span class="s1">databases. Issues on knowledge formats, standards, and open source </span><span class="s1">development will be discussed. As a practical use case, we connected </span><span class="s1">Diversicon to the the S-Match semantic matcher tool in order to support </span><span class="s1">domain-aware semantic matching ([<span class="s2">http://semanticmatching.org</span>](http://semanticmatching.org/)).</span>
