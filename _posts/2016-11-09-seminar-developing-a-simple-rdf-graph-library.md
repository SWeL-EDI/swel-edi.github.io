**Date:** 11:15, 14 November

**Venue:** [F.17. Colin Maclaurin Building](http://www.hw.ac.uk/student-life/campus-life/edinburgh/colin-maclaurin-building.htm), Heriot-Watt University

**Title:** <span class="s1">Developing a simple RDF graph library</span>

**Speaker:** [Rob Stewart](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rs46/), Heriot-Watt University

**Abstract:** <span class="s1">In this talk I shall present the design and the implementation details </span><span class="s1">of a simple Haskell library for working with RDF data. The library </span><span class="s1">supports parsing and pretty printing for the XML/Turtle/NTriple RDF </span><span class="s1">serialisation formats, and graph querying. It has multiple in-memory </span><span class="s1">representations for RDF graphs, exposed as a parameter to the programmer </span><span class="s1">to meet their application specific needs.</span>

<span class="s1">The presentation will cover: the API, how the various RDF graph </span><span class="s1">representations are implemented internally, the W3C testsuite that this </span><span class="s1">library uses to ensure W3C RDF spec conformance, and the libraryâ€™s </span><span class="s1">performance benchmarking suite.</span>
