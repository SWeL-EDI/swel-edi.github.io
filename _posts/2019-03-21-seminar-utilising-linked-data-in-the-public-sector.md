**Title:** Utilising Linked Data in the Public Sector

**Speaker:** [Angus Addlesee](http://addlesee.co.uk/), PhD Student, Heriot-Watt University

**Date:** 11:15 on 25 March 2019

**Location:** CM F.17, Heriot-Watt University

**Abstract:** In this presentation I will explain how Wallscope (a small tech company in Edinburgh) is using linked data in public sector projects.

**Bio:** Angus has worked at Wallscope for two years in various roles and is now studying his PhD at Heriot-Watt which is part funded by Wallscope.

Wallscope uses Machine Learning and Semantic Technologies to build Knowledge Graphs and Linked Data applications. We are motivated to lower the barriers for accessing knowledge to improve the health, wealth and sustainability of the world we share.
