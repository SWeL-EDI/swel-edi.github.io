UPDATE: there is a new W3C community group [schema course extend](https://www.w3.org/community/schema-course-extend/2015/12/10/call-for-participation-in-schema-course-extension-community-group/) set up to progress these ideas. Please join if you are interested.

This is essentially an invite to get involved with building a schema extension for educational courses, by way of a description of work so far. If you want to reply it’s sent as an [email schema.org mail list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/2015Dec/thread.html#first).

About a year ago there was a flurry of discussion about [wanting to markup descriptions of courses in schema](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/195). Vicky Tardiff-Holland produced [a proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12YWjLzZC8FiTiOwSAETRIEozeqZdn6O8a4fgqK4t5Ss/edit#) which we discussed in [LRMI](http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/AB-Comm/ed/LRMI/TG) and elsewhere as a result of which various suggestions were and comments were added to that proposal.

I also led [some work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-s5HjNkWUtIoLAHjRcUZljBWEdHQIupk-KscAEIbFA/edit#) in LRMI around scope, use cases, requirements, existing data; which I hope will lead to validating/refining the proposal by some example data that could be used to demonstrate that it met the use cases.

I am up for another push on courses. I share [the doc I was working on](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-s5HjNkWUtIoLAHjRcUZljBWEdHQIupk-KscAEIbFA/edit#) in the hope that it is good starting point. It’s a bit long, so here is an overview of what it contains:

- scope: concerning discovery of any type of educational course (online/offline, long/short, scheduled/on-demand) Educational course defined as “some sequence of events and/or creative works which aims to build knowledge, competence or ability of learners”. (out of scope: information about students and their progression etc; information needed internally for course management rather than discovery)
- comparators: a review of some established ways of sharing similar data
- use cases
- requirements arising from the use cases
- mapping to some existing examples. I used [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/) to annotate existing web pages that describe different types of course, e.g. from Coursera or a University, tagging the requirement that the data was relevant to. Here’s [an example of a page as tagged](https://goo.gl/1IWjOh) (click on a yellow highlight to show the relevant requirement as a comment with a tag)  
    hypothes.is aggregates the selected information for each tag, to give a list of the information relevant to each use case, [for example cost](https://hypothes.is/stream?q=tag:%27reqC%27)

I think the next step would be to review the use cases and requirements in light of some of the observations from the mapping, and to look again at the proposal to see how it reflects the data available/required. But first I want to try to get more people involved, see whether anyone has a better idea for how to progress, or if anyone wants to check the work so far and help move it forward.

Finally, I’m aware the docs and discussions so far around schema for courses are a scattered set of scraps and drafts. If there is enough interest it would be really useful to have it in one place.
