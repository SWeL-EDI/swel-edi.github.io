During the summer, [BridgeDb](http://bridgedb.org/) has had a Google Summer of Code student working on extending the system to work with secondary identifiers; these are alternative identifiers for a given resource.

The student [Manas Awasthi](https://medium.com/@marvex17) has maintained a blog of his experiences. Below are some excerpts of his activity.

> Google Summer of Code, an annual Google program which encourages open source contribution from students. The term I was introduced to by my seniors in my freshman year. Having no clue about open source, I started gathering knowledge about *‘How to contribute to open source projects?’* Then I came across version control, being a freshman it was an unknown territory for me. I started using Github for my personal projects which gave me a better understanding of how to use it. Version Control Service was off the checklists. By the time all this was done Google Summer of Code 2018 was announced.

> **The Coding Period: The First Two Weeks**  
> The coding period of Google Summer of Code started on 27th of May, at the time of publishing it’s been more than 2 weeks, here I am writing this blog to discuss what I have done over the past two weeks, and what a ride it has been already. Plenty of coding along with plenty of learning. From the code base to the test suite.

> Hola Amigos!!! Let’s discuss my progress through week 3 and 4 of GSoC’s coding period. So the major part of what I was doing this week was to add support for the secondary identifier (err!!! whats that) to BridgeDb.

> Hey Folks, this is probably the last blog in this series outlining my journey as a GSoC student. In this blog I’ll go through the functionality I have added over the summer and why the end-users should use it.
