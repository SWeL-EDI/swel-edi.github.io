After 3 years hard work, countless telephone conferences, issues and drafts, the [W3C Health Cara and Life Sciences Community Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/sw/hcls/) (HCLS) have finally published their [community profile for describing datasets](http://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/). The profile deals with different versions of a dataset with each version being published in multiple formats. Below is the announcement from the W3C.

> <span>The </span>[Semantic Web Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/sw/hcls/)<span> has published a Group Note of </span>[Dataset Descriptions: HCLS Community Profile](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-hcls-dataset-20150514/)<span>. Access to consistent, high-quality metadata is critical to finding, understanding, and reusing scientific data. This document describes a consensus among participating stakeholders in the Health Care and the Life Sciences domain on the description of datasets using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This specification meets key functional requirements, reuses existing vocabularies to the extent that it is possible, and addresses elements of data description, versioning, provenance, discovery, exchange, query, and retrieval.
