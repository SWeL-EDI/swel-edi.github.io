The Semantic Web Lab will be hosting the [6th Scottish Linked Data Interest Group workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/scottishlinkeddata/events/sliding6) on 29 May. It will be a great opportunity for those in Scotland interested in the Semantic Web and Linked Data to come together to discuss their recent successes and future challenges.

Full details can be found on the event [website](https://sites.google.com/site/scottishlinkeddata/events/sliding6).
