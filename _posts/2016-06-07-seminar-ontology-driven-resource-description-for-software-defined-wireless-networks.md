**Title:** Ontology-Driven Resource Description for Software Defined Wireless Networks

**Speaker:** [Qianru Zhou](http://home.eps.hw.ac.uk/~qz1/), PhD student, Advanced Wireless Technologies (AWiTec) Lab, <span class="s5">[Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.eps.hw.ac.uk/), [Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk)</span>

**Abstract:** The future management and control of wireless communication networks will rely on developing the most appropriate abstraction to represent various network elements. In order to provide high-level abstraction and enhance network programmability to mine these data, a semantic-based network information modeling approach is required. In this presentation, a ontology is built for software defined wireless networks (SDWNs) and the methodology for modeling based on the proposed ontology of the network information is illustrated in detail. By applying data mining to extract implicit and valuable information from the proposed SDWN information model, “Lost Silence”, which can recognize the pattern of a disaster and provide an early alert service, is developed utilizing a real life scenario.
