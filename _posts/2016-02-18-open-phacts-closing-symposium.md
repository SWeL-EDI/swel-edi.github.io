For the last 5 years I have had the pleasure of working with the [Open PHACTS project](http://www.openphacts.org/). Sadly, the project is now at an end. To celebrate we are having a [two day symposium](http://www.openphactsfoundation.org/linking-life-science-data-final-speakers-and-agenda/#more-3176) to look over the contributions of the project and its future legacy.

The project has been hugely successful in developing an integrated data platform to enable drug discovery research (see a future post for details to support this claim). The result of the project is the [Open PHACTS Foundation](http://www.openphactsfoundation.org/) which will now own the drug discovery platform and sustain its development into the future.

Here are my slides on the state of the data in the Open PHACTS 2.0 platform.
