Iâ€™m currently involved in a couple of projects relating to representing course information as linked data / schema.org.

## 1. Course information in schema.org

As you may know the idea of using LRMI / schema.org for describing courses has been mooted several times over the last two or three years, here and on the main schema.org mail lists. Most recently, Wes Turner opened [an issue on github](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/195) which attracted some attention and some proposed solutions.

I lead a work package within the [DCMI LRMI Task Group](http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/AB-Comm/ed/LRMI/TG) to try to take this forwards. To that end I and some colleagues in the Task Group have given some thought to what the scope and use cases to be addressed might be, mostly relating to course advertising and discovery. You can see [our notes as a Google Doc](https://goo.gl/CO6vKc), you should be able to add comments to this document and we would welcome your thoughts. In particular we would like to know whether there are any missing use cases or requirements. Other offers of help and ideas would also be welcome!

I plan to compare the derived requirements with the proposed solutions and with the data typically provided in web pages.

## 2. Institutional course data as linked data

Stefan Dietze commented on the schema.org course information work that it would be worth looking at similar existing vocabularies. That linked nicely with some other work that a colleague, [Anna Grant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annalgrant), is undertaking, looking at how we might represent and use course data from our department as linked data (this is similar to some of the work I saw [presented in the Linked Learning workshop in Florence](http://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/linked-learning-highlights-from-florence-lile2015/)). She is reviewing the relevant vocabularies that we can find (AIISO, TEACH, XCRI-CAP, CourseWare, MLO, CEDS). There is [a working draft](https://goo.gl/2J8P7v) on which we would welcome comments.
