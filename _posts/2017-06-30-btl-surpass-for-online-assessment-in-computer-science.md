Over the last couple of years I have been leading the introduction of [BTL’s Surpass](http://www.btl.com/surpass/) online assessment platform for exams in Computer Science. I posted the [requirements for an online exam system](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/requirements-online-exam-system/) we agreed on a few months ago. I have now written up an evaluation case study: [Use of BTL Surpass for online exams in Computer Science, an LTDI report](http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/publicationFiles/2017/SurpassReport/) ([local copy](https://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/content/uploads/evalCaseStudy.pdf)). TL;DR: nothing is perfect, but Surpass did what we hoped, and it is planned to continue &amp; expand its use.

My colleagues Hans-Wofgang has also presented on our experiences of “[Enhancing the Learning Experience on Programming-focused Courses via Electronic Assessment Tools](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TFPIE2017/TFPIE_2017/Papers/TFPIE_2017_paper_3.pdf)” at the [Trends in Functional Programming in Education Conference](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/events/tfp17/), Canterbury, 19-21. This paper includes work by Sanusi Usman on using Surpass for formative assessment.
