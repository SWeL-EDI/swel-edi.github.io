<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday 16 May, several interested individuals (including myself) from </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">ELIXIR</span>](https://www.elixir-europe.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">bioCADDIE</span>](https://biocaddie.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bioschemas</span>](http://bioschemas.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">W3C HCLS Community Profile</span>](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> met with representatives from </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span>](https://www.google.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">schema.org</span>](http://schema.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> activity on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">describing datasets</span>](https://schema.org/Dataset)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding datasets, and understanding their content, is a challenging task for humans and currently not possible to automate. Schema.org is an initiative from the major web search engines to help with the discovery of web resource. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple parallel activities in the life sciences community working on developing ways to publish metadata about datasets. This is due to the wide variety of use cases that dataset descriptions need to satisfy, including data discovery, data citation, and provenance tracking. bioCADDIE has worked on an </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">extensive analysis</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12FS-yW0B4unZEVOZhe7wQ-eWBUwecUpVs-EU28jso9I/edit)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of use cases mapping data models from existing efforts. We agreed this could be used as a basis to improve the existing schema.org dataset type and come up with a new Bioschemas dataset specification.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcomes of the meeting with Google was to focus on the find-ability of datasets with an emphasis on data citation. For data citation the following key properties are important (as stated in the FORCE 11 </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">data citation principles</span>](https://www.force11.org/datacitation)<span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next steps will be to develop some pilot projects to both publish and use dataset descriptions for discovery and citation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[ELIXIR-UK](http://www.elixir-uk.org/) members are heavily involved in [Bioschemas.org](http://bioschemas.org/) and will be involved in these efforts as part of the ELIXIR interoperability platform activities in collaboration with NIH and ELIXIR-EBI.</span>
