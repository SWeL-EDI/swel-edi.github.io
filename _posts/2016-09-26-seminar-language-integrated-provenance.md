**Title:** Language-integrated Provenance

**Speaker:** [Stefan Fehrenbach](http://stefan-fehrenbach.net/), Informatics, University of Edinburgh

**Abstract:** <span class="s1">Provenance, or information about the origin or derivation of </span><span class="s1">data, is important for assessing the trustworthiness of data and </span><span class="s1">identifying and correcting mistakes. Most prior implementations </span><span class="s1">of data provenance have involved heavyweight modifications to </span><span class="s1">database systems and little attention has been paid to how the </span><span class="s1">provenance data can be used outside such a system. We present </span><span class="s1">extensions to the Links programming language that build on its </span><span class="s1">support for language-integrated query to support provenance </span><span class="s1">queries by rewriting and normalizing monadic comprehensions and </span><span class="s1">extending the type system to distinguish provenance metadata from </span><span class="s1">normal data. We show that the two most common forms of provenance </span><span class="s1">can be implemented efficiently and used safely as a programming </span><span class="s1">language feature with no changes to the database system.</span>

**Bio:** Stefan is <span class="s1">a second year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh where he </span><span class="s1">works with James Cheney on language support for provenance. </span>
