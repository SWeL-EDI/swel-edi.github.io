A new version of the Linked Open Data (LOD) [cloud](http://lod-cloud.net/) has been produced and it shows quite a shift from the previous version. It is great to see the LOD cloud continue to grow both in scale and diversity.

</div>[Previously](http://lod-cloud.net/versions/2014-08-30/lod-cloud_colored.svg) DBPedia and GeoNames were the centre of the LOD universe. While DBPedia still remains an important linking dataset, it is now clear that there are clusterings within application domains. This is most significant in the life sciences.
