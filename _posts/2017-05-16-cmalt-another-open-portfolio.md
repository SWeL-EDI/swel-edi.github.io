I’ve finally made a start on drafting my CMALT Portfolio ([and so has Lorna](http://lornamcampbell.org/cmalt/cmalt-an-open-portfolio/),\* we’re writing buddies), and in the interests of open practice I’m going to attempt to write the whole thing as an open Google doc before moving it here on my blog. I have a shared folder on Google Drive, [Phil’s CMALT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4F3edllhRkvcE5MbzNQWGZJeE0?usp=sharing), where I’ll be building up my portfolio over the coming weeks. I’ve made a start drafting the first two Core Areas: [Operational Issues](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vChNhhRr2bTNBKuF1vbzPLrD-ByXzj8vAuosB4uzdeE) and [Learning Teaching and Assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13pSLiYsnS7-A1jnXkp_ERjW3jnkxnzoOwnhSp6ZYiqo/edit?usp=sharing), I’ll be adding more sections shortly, I hope. I’d love to have some feedback on my portfolio so if you’ve got any thoughts, comments or guidance I’d be very grateful indeed. I’d also be very interested to know if anyone else has created their portfolio as an exercise in open practice, and if so, how they found the experience.

Wish me luck!

More importantly, she let me copy her idea as well. That’s open practice which can’t be formally licensed, though I know that she is cool with it.
