<div class="wp-block-cover has-background-dim">![](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/SWeL/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/escience_3-1.jpg)<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"></div></div> I was away from September 22 â€“ 28, 2019 for attending the [15th eScience Conference, San Diego, California, USA.](https://escience2019.sdsc.edu/) It was my first experience to attend the international conference in which I presented my paper. The objective of the eScience Conference is to promote innovation in collaborative, computationally- or data-intensive research across all disciplines, throughout the research lifecycle. This conference was also co-located with the Gateways 2019 conference. The two conferences will offer a shared keynote, presentations about mutually interesting topics, and a shared evening reception, as well as opportunities for mingling during the breaks. Conference attendees will have the option to register for one or both conferences, in full or in part. These two audiences share interests, content, and culture. This is an opportunity to attend both events!

 This was the great trip for me because I learnt a lot from it by attending the relevant workshop, presentation and keynotes. My presentation was in [Research Object workshop 2019](https://researchobject.github.io/ro2019/). There were total six workshops

- **[Advanced Knowledge Technologies for Science in a FAIR World (AKTS)](https://www.isi.edu/ikcap/akts/akts2019/)**
- **[Bridging from Concepts to Data and Computation for eScience (BC2DCâ€™19)](https://bc2dc.github.io/)**
- **[Data Teaching Workshop (DTW2019)](https://github.com/EDISONcommunity/EDSF/wiki/(1)-DTW2019-Data-Teaching-Workshop-September-2019,-San-Diego)**
- **[Platform-driven e-Infrastructure Innovations (EINFRA)](https://www.process-project.eu/workshops/)**
- **[Research Objects 2019 (RO2019)](https://researchobject.github.io/ro2019/)**
- **[Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Data Analytics](https://awsesciencetutorial.splashthat.com/)**
 
  
#### First Day (24th, September 2019)

 My workshop was on the first day. So, I was very nervous about my presentation. This RO workshop consists of 15 members that includes professors with lot of research experience. <figure class="wp-block-image">![](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/SWeL/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/poster_escience-1024x1024.jpeg)<figcaption>Poster eScience 2019</figcaption></figure> In the Research Object workshop, first presented the Research Objects by [Carole Goble](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1219-2137) that a merging approach to the publication, and exchange of scholarly information on the Web. Research Objects aim to improve reuse and reproducibility by:

- Supporting the publication of more than just PDFs, making data, code, and other resources first class citizens of scholarship
- Recognizing that there is often a need to publish collections of these resources together as one shareable, cite-able resource.
- Enriching these resources and collections with any and all additional information required to make research reusable, and reproducible!
 
 Research objects are not just data, not just collections, but any digital resource that aims to go beyond the PDF for scholarly publishing! <figure class="wp-block-image">![](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/SWeL/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/carole-1024x1024.jpeg)<figcaption>Welcome Research Objects 2019 By Carole Goble</figcaption></figure> The keynote speaker was the [Bertram LudÃ¤scher](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/bertram-ludascher), who presented: *From Research Objects to Reproducible Science Tales.* In his presentation, he talked about what we mean by reproducibility, identify tool and thinking gaps, and bridging gaps.

 </div> Another presentation about [RO-Crate](https://zenodo.org/record/3337883#.XaJgzkZKjBU), the new advancement in the Research Object presented by Stian Soiland-Reyes. This is increasingly important as researchers now rely heavily on computational analysis, yet they are facing a reproducibility crisis as key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported. They are developing Research Object Crate (or RO-Crate for short), a lightweight approach to package research data with their structured metadata, based on schema.org annotations in a formalized JSON-LD format that can be used independent of infrastructure to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.

After attending the five more presentations, we would go for the lunch in front of the sea view. It was very amazing view while taking the lunch. After finishing the lunch, first presentation was mine. So, I presented work at the Data Quality Issues in Current Nanopublications by performing the data analysis of using existing datasets (DisGeNET, neXtProt, LIDDI, OpenBEL, WikiPathways).

</figure> In my presentation, I discussed the data quality issues in the nanopublications while generating the nanopublications. The data quality issues mean that

- General lack of provenance and publication information
- Misuse of authoring/publishing ontology terms
- Lack of domain expertise and database content
 
 So there is the Need for domain best practice guidelines for generating the good quality nanopublications. Our analysis is also available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/ImranAsif48/RO2019). <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-slideshare wp-block-embed-slideshare"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="356" loading="lazy" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/fb0cvy5xuiPcuW" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" title="Data Quality Issues in Current Nanopublications" width="427"> </iframe><div style="margin-bottom:5px">  **[Data Quality Issues in Current Nanopublications](https://www.slideshare.net/imranasifquaidian/data-quality-issues-in-current-nanopublications "Data Quality Issues in Current Nanopublications")**  from **[imranasifquaidian](https://www.slideshare.net/imranasifquaidian)** </div></div><figcaption>Data Quality Issues in Current Nanopublications</figcaption></figure>#### Second Day (25th, September 2019)

 The Second Day start with the keynote Speaker Randy Olson, He discussed about the framework ABT (AND, But and Therefore) that The ABT Narrative Template is a new tool for organizing the narrative structure of any amount of content. It is at the core of storytelling, logic, reason, argument and the scientific method. How to divide the big sentences into the ABT format and solve the problem. It is the idea of shrinking a narrative thread down to a single sentence using three connector words: and, but, therefore. In this day, lot of other presentations were held about the eScience and Gateway and challenges about these terminologies. <figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">![](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/SWeL/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tweet_ABTpng-1024x1024.png)</figure>#### Third Day (26th, September 2019)

 The Third Day start with the keynote Speaker Manish Parashar, He discussed about the Exploring the Future of Facilities-based, Driven-Driven Science. In this day, lot of other presentations were held about the eScience and Gateway and challenges about these terminologies. <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto d-block">> 3rd day in [\#eScience2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eScience2019?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) conference with Keynote: Manish Parashar on "Exploring the Future of Facilities-based, Driven-Driven Science" [pic.twitter.com/jfyhJOqTYx](https://t.co/jfyhJOqTYx)

 </div>  Overall, I really enjoyed the conference. I got a chance to spend sometime with a bunch of members of the community and itâ€™s exciting to see the continued excitement and the number of new research questions.
