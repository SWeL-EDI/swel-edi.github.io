This week I went to the [UK Ontology Network meeting](https://www.keele.ac.uk/scm/events/conferences/ukon2018/) hosted at [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/). There was an interesting array of talks in the programme showing the breadth of work going on in the UK.

I gave a talk on the [Bioschemas Community](http://bioschemas.org/) (slides below) and [Leyla Garcia](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/leyla-jael-garcia-castro) presented a poster providing more details of the current [Bioschema Profiles](http://bioschemas.org/specifications/).

The UK Ontology Network is going through a reflection phase and would like interested parties to complete the following online survey.
