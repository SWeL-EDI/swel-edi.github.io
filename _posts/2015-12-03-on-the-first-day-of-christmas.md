<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> and with apologies:

On the first day of Christmas  
My true love gave to me  
A testable hypoth-e-sis

On the second day of Christmas  
My truelove gave to me  
Two sample means  
And a testable hypothesis

On the third day of Christmas  
My true love gave to me  
Three peer reviews  
Two sample means  
And a testable hypothesis

On the fourth day of Christmas  
My true love gave to me

Three peer reviews  
Two sample means  
And a testable hypothesis

On the fifth day of Christmas  
My true love gave to me  
FIIIVE SIGMAA RuuuuLE

(I always thought the carol went down hill from there)
