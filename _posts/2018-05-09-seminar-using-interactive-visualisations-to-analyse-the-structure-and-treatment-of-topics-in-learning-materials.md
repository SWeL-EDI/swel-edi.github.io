**Title:** Using Interactive Visualisations to Analyse the Structure and Treatment of Topics in Learning Materials

**Speaker:** [Tanya Howden](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/texturelab/people/tanya-howden/), Heriot-Watt University

**Date:** 11:30 on 14 May 2018

**Location:** CM F.17, Heriot-Watt University

**Abstract:** With the amount of information available online growing, it is becoming more and more difficult to find what you are looking for, particularly when you’re in an area that you have very little background in. For example, if you were learning about neural networks for the first time, the number of responses you get from a simple Google search can be overwhelming – how do you know where to start?! This is only one of the many challenges faced when searching for appropriate learning materials.

In this talk, I will be discussing the motivations behind my research interests before introducing and demonstrating a prototype that has been created with the aim to give learners a more engaging environment with unified organisation and access to different materials on one subject.
