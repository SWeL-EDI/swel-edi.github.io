**Abstract:** Offshore decommissioning activities represent a significant business opportunity for UK contracting and consulting companies, albeit they constitute liability to the owners of the assets – because of the cost – and UK government – because of tax relief. The silver lining is that waste reuse can bring some reprieve as savings from the sales of decommissioned facility items can reduce the overall removal cost to an asset owner. However, characterizing an asset inventory to determine which decommissioned facility items can be reused is prone to errors because of the difficulty involved in integrating asset data from different sources in a meaningful way. This research investigates a data integration framework, which enables rapid assessment of items to be decommissioned, to inform circular economy principles. It evaluates existing practices in the domain and devises a mechanisms for higher productivity using the semantic web and ISO 15926.
