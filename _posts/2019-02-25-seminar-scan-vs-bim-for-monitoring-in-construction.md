**Title:**Scan-vs-BIM for monitoring in construction

**Speaker:** Frédéric Bosché, Associate Professor in Construction Informatics,  
Director of the Institute for Sustainable Building Design (ISBD), and Leader of the CyberBuild Lab. Heriot-Watt University

**Date:** 11:15 on 4 March 2019

**Location:** CM F.17, Heriot-Watt University

**Abstract:** When Laser Scanning and Building Information Modelling (BIM) technologies were emerging, the construction industry showed significant interest in what were to be eventually called “Scan-to-BIM”: the process of using a laser scanned point clouds to develop BIM models of existing assets. However, with the use of BIM for design, another important use of these technologies is what some have called “Scan-vs-BIM”: the comparison of reality capture 3D point clouds (capturing the as-is states of constructions) to BIM models (representing the as-designed states of constructions). Scan-vs-BIM offers significant opportunities for further automation in construction project delivery for example for progress or quality control.

This talk will present the Scan-vs-BIM concept, illustrate its process and benefits. The talk will then expand on the subject of using the output of Scan-vs-BIM processing to enhance dimensional quality control with a view to evolve dimensional quality control from a traditionally point-based measurement process to a surface-based measurement process.

**Bio:** Frédéric graduated holds a PhD in Civil Engineering, but also worked as a PostDoc in the Computer Vision group of ETH Zurich, Switzerland for 2.5 years. He is currently Associate Professor in the School of the Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society (EGIS). Frédéric leads the CyberBuild Lab (<http://cyberbuild.hw.ac.uk/>), and his research covers two main areas:

1. Processing of reality capture data to enhance asset construction and life cycle management.
2. Development and use of virtual and mixed reality technology, to support collaborative and engaging design, construction and engineering works, as well as training.

Frédéric has published over 70 peer-reviewed papers in internationally-recognised journal and conferences, and his research has received a few international research and innovation awards, including two CIOB International Research &amp; Innovation awards in 2016, and the IAARC Tucker-Hasegawa Award in 2018 for “distinguished contributions to the field of automation and robotics in construction”. Frédéric is a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction (IAARC), and he is Associate Editor of Automation in Construction (Elsevier).
