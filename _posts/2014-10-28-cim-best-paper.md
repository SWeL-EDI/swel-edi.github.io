<span>Our paper \[[1](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ajg33/cim-best-paper/#paperkey_1)\] presenting a framework for terminology mappings won one of two best paper awards at the First Workshop on Context, Interpretation and Meaning ([CIM2014](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fm206/cim14/)). The other award went to the paper by [Amy Guy](http://rhiaro.co.uk/) from the University of Edinburgh.</span>

abstract = {Use of medical terminologies and mappings across them are consid- ered to be crucial pre-requisites for achieving interoperable eHealth applica- tions. However, experiences from several research projects have demonstrated that the mappings are not enough. Also the context of the mappings is needed to enable interpretation of the meaning of the mappings. Built upon these experi- ences, we introduce a semantic framework for representing, evaluating and uti- lizing terminology mappings together with the context in terms of the justifica- tions for, and the provenance of, the mappings. The framework offers a plat- form for i) performing various mappings strategies, ii) representing terminology mappings together with their provenance information, and iii) enabling termi- nology reasoning for inferring both new and erroneous mappings. We present the results of the introduced framework using the SALUS project where we evaluated the quality of both existing and inferred terminology mappings among standard terminologies.},
