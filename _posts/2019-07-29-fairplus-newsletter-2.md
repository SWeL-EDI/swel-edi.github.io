Below is the opening exert from the [second FAIRplus Newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/ec6eb86c5ac7/fairplus-newsletter-no-1293553):

> Though FAIRplus has been running for just six months, there is already a lot to talk about. [Our two task-focused ‘Squads’ have booted up and begun the FAIRification](https://mailchi.mp/ec6eb86c5ac7/fairplus-newsletter-no-1293553#squads) of the first set of four pilot datasets, our industry partners in EFPIA organised the [first ‘Bring Your Own Data’ workshop in London](https://mailchi.mp/ec6eb86c5ac7/fairplus-newsletter-no-1293553#byod), and we’ve been busy explaining our goals and [answering many questions from our stakeholders](https://mailchi.mp/ec6eb86c5ac7/fairplus-newsletter-no-1293553#faq).
> 
> You can read about these activities in this second FAIRplus newsletter. On top of that, we bring you an update on upcoming events, news from our partners and also a [new section ‘Track our progress’](https://mailchi.mp/ec6eb86c5ac7/fairplus-newsletter-no-1293553#deliverables) where you can check for yourself how we are progressing towards our goals and what Deliverables and reports we’ve recently submitted.
> 
> Finally, [we’ve launched our own LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fairplus). Besides regular updates on our activities, it will also feature job opportunities and news from the FAIRplus partners.
> 
> The next FAIRplus Newsletter will come out in November 2019. In it we’ll present the FAIRplus Fellowship programme, report on the FAIR workshop in October and more.
>
