The Semantic Web Lab was founded in January 2014\* to promote research and discussion on aspects of data integration, visualisation, and analysis using Semantic Web technology. The lab is based in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/cs/) within the [School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/). However, members of the lab are also based in the [School of Engineering and Physical Sciences](https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/engineering-physical-sciences/) and the [School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society](https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/energy-geoscience-infrastructure-society/).

Reflecting the wider mission of [Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk), the lab has an applied focus, with prominent work in the domains of pharmaceuticals, and environmental and disaster management. The lab has wide collaborations within academia, industry, and the public sector.

\*[Fiona McNeil](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fm206/) and [Alasdair Gray](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ajg33/) conceived the idea of founding the Heriot-Watt Semantic Web Lab at the ISWC 2014 conference banquet, Riva del Garda, Italy.
